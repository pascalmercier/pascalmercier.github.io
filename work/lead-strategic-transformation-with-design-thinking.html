		<h1>Reframing Strategy with Sticky Notes and Sharp Thinking</h1>
		<p><strong>Bringing clarity, alignment, and velocity to a strategic transformation through collaborative design.</strong></p>
		<p>What happens when a major enterprise needs to pivot quickly but struggles to align its leadership team? You roll up your sleeves and guide them through a three-day remote sprint. I helped a cross-functional group make decisions faster, identify shared priorities, and translate strategy into tangible next steps.</p>

		<h2>ðŸ’¡ The Backdrop</h2>
		<p>Leadership had big ambitions. Their goal? Shift the organization from a reactive, siloed structure toward an experience-led, product-driven model. But between competing priorities, fragmented communication, and ambiguous goals, they were spinning in circles.</p>
		<p>That's where I came in.</p>

		<h2>ðŸ§­ A Different Kind of Design Sprint</h2>
		<p>The traditional playbook wouldn't cut it. Instead, we designed a collaborative remote sprint tailored for a dozen leaders spread across teams and time zones. My role was to co-facilitate the sprint and lead the design work throughout the week.</p>
		<h3>Day-by-Day Breakdown</h3>
		<p><strong>Day 1:</strong> We clarified the challenge, mapped the system, and surfaced the biggest blockers.</p>
		<p><strong>Day 2:</strong> Using How Might We statements, we reframed challenges into opportunities, sketched ideas, and voted on high-potential directions.</p>
		<p><strong>Day 3:</strong> We transformed a pile of sticky notes and sketches into a shared strategic narrative, wrapped in a visual prototype.</p>

		<span class="figure-legend"><strong>A clearer vision emerges</strong> â€” Remote sprint setup in FigJam. After three days of collaborative work, the board was filled with insights, sketches, and shared decisions.</span>

		<h2>ðŸŽ¯ Results That Mattered</h2>
		<p>The impact went far beyond a prototype:</p>
		<ul class="p-list">
		  <li><strong>Sharper alignment:</strong> Teams gained clarity on which bets to prioritize and which distractions to drop.</li>
			<li><strong>Accelerated decisions:</strong> What usually took weeks was resolved in days, helping key leaders move forward with confidence.</li>
			<li><strong>Shared vision:</strong> By co-creating the prototype, stakeholders saw their ideas reflected in the outcome. This dramatically improved buy-in and helped rally others around the new direction.</li>
		</ul>

		</div>
		<span class="figure-legend">We delivered a vision and a storyline as a team. We also designed a prototype to convey concepts visually.</span>

		<h2>âœ… Key Learnings</h2>
		<ul class="p-list">
      <li><strong>Facilitated collaboration creates momentum.</strong> Structured sprints reduce hesitation and build alignment faster than decks and meetings ever could.</li>
      <li><strong>Visualizing strategy fosters actionable discussions.</strong> Diagrams, boards, and prototypes make it easier to break down complexity and communicate vision.</li>
      <li><strong>Prototypes aren't just for users.</strong> They're powerful tools for leadership to pressure-test assumptions and drive internal alignment.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>ðŸ“Š Estimated Outcomes</h2>
		<ul class="p-list">
      <li>Cut alignment time from 4+ weeks to just 3 days.</li>
      <li>Increased cross-functional collaboration, with participants positively reporting on clarity and involvement post-sprint.</li>
      <li>3 months later, several sprint outcomes had evolved into funded initiatives, endorsed at the VP level.</li>
    </ul>
