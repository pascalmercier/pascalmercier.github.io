		<h1>Behind the Build: Reimagining a Community Platform from the Ground Up</h1>
		<p><strong>How we created a community-driven hub that empowered users to connect, contribute, and co-create with a playful UX and a scalable foundation, as a team.</strong></p>
		<p>What do you get when you combine a passion for self-served demo customization, a growing network of Solution Engineers, and an aging platform struggling to keep up? An opportunity. One I embraced as the UX architect, leading a team of junior designers and engineers to reinvent the experience from the ground up‚Äîfor both creators and consumers of demo components.</p>

		<h2>ü§î Challenge to Solve</h2>
		<p><strong>How might we offer a user experience that encourages participation, facilitates discovery, and makes contributors feel proud of their involvement?</strong></p>
		<p>We knew the challenge wasn‚Äôt just about features. It was about cultivating a sense of belonging, helping users feel empowered to share their work, discover relevant content, and connect with others in meaningful ways.</p>

		<h2>ü•æÔ∏è Path to Solution</h2>
		<h3>Listening First</h3>
		<p>We started with interviews and community surveys. Creators felt friction at every step: publishing was clunky, profiles were impersonal, and the system didn‚Äôt reflect their efforts or foster discovery.</p>
		<h3>Designing with Roles in Mind</h3>
		<p>We designed for three core personas:</p>
		<ul class="p-list">
		  <li><strong>Contributors</strong> who wanted a smooth way to share and track their work.</li>
      <li><strong>Visitors</strong> who came to learn, explore, and maybe become contributors themselves.</li>
      <li><strong>Community Managers</strong> who needed oversight, analytics, and moderation tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <img src="../img/work/demo-components_homepage.png" alt="Demo Components homepage" class="screenshot desktop"/>
		<span class="figure-legend"><strong>New demo components homepage</strong> ‚Äî Solution Engineers land on a sleek, centralized hub where all demo components and resources are organized for quick, effortless access, setting the stage for smooth demo preparation.</span>
		<h3>Enhancing Content Accessibility with a Robust API Layer</h3>
		<p>To enhance scalability and maintainability, we transitioned to a microservices architecture. This allowed individual components to be developed, deployed, and updated independently, fostering innovation and reducing interdependencies.</p>

			<img src="../img/work/demo-components_search.png" alt="Advanced search feature" class="screenshot"/>
		</div>
		<span class="figure-legend"><strong>Demo component detail view and search results on desktop</strong> ‚Äî Users can dive deep into individual demo components or quickly find what they need using an intuitive search‚Äîmaking exploration and preparation a breeze.</span>

		</div>
		<span class="figure-legend"><strong>Demo component detail view and search results on mobile</strong> ‚Äî Optimized for on-the-go users, these screens let you explore component details and perform quick searches anytime, anywhere.</span>
		<h3>Elevating the Community Feel</h3>
		<p>We focused on micro-interactions and content discovery:</p>
		<ul class="p-list">
		  <li>Celebrated contributor profiles.</li>
			<li>Surfaced most loved and most helpful content.</li>
			<li>Added commenting, reactions, and content suggestions.</li>
		</ul>
		<img src="../img/work/demo-components_celebration.gif" alt="The creation of new demo components is a celebration" class="screenshot"/>
		<span class="figure-legend"><strong>Celebrating contribution with micro-interactions</strong> ‚Äî Small but powerful animations and feedback moments that make contributing feel rewarding and engaging, turning everyday actions into delightful experiences.</span>

		<h2>üöÄ Outcomes That Speak Volumes</h2>
		<p>This was our first full end-to-end design project at Salesforce, led by a young, dynamic team hungry for impact. The results? Clear and compelling:</p>
		<ul class="p-list">
		  <li><strong>Doubled contributor engagement within just two months</strong>, fueling the growth of a vibrant platform with <strong>over 8,800 active users</strong>, each one empowered to share, explore, and build more effectively.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduced content publishing time by 40%</strong>, streamlining workflows and automating moderation to get high-quality components out the door faster.</li>
			<li><strong>Increased content discoverability by 60%</strong>, thanks to improved search engine and a cleaner content structure which helped drive over 41,000 component installs just a couple years in.</li>
			<li><strong>Reduced content management overhead significantly</strong>, empowering the newly formed support team with moderation tools and automation keeping <strong>960+ components actively maintained</strong> without burning out the folks behind the scenes.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>üìö Key Learnings</h2>
		<ul class="p-list">
		  <li><strong>Designing mobile-first promotes clarity and simplicity.</strong> It highlights essential information and naturally leads to structures that are easier for users to navigate, resulting in cleaner, more effective designs.</li>
			<li><strong>It takes a village to build, launch, support, and evolve a product.</strong> Orchestration hinges on strategic alignment getting the right people moving in the right direction at the right time.</li>
			<li><strong>Keeping the end user front and center isn‚Äôt just a design principle, it‚Äôs a critical driver of success.</strong> When teams align around user outcomes, decision-making sharpens, priorities become clearer, and products deliver real impact.</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>üß© Final Thoughts</h2>
		<p>Building this platform wasn‚Äôt just a technical upgrade. It was about turning a quiet content site into a buzzing digital town square. It worked because we put the community first and gave them the tools to thrive.</p>
